# FunkyCalculator

FunkyCalculator is my first swiftUI project and it functions as a simple calculator. FunkyCalculator was created by combining Letsbuildthatapp’s [Calculator SwiftUI tutorial](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/courses/Calculator%20SwiftUI) for the UI, and Dr. Angela Yu’s Calculator Project tutorial in the [The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) for the functionality.

FunkyCalculator was built with Xcode and written entirely in Swift 5X. The design was created using SwiftUI.
